Description: This package is devoted to runoff prediction in ungauged basins (PUB), i.e., predicting water runoff at locations where no runoff data are available. 
             This lack of data presents considerable challenges to catchment managers who require information on water flows for decision making. 
             This package, based on the recently published book, "Runoff Prediction in Ungauged Basins: Synthesis across Processes, Places and Scales", provides hydrologists with examples of methods to address this critical challenge. 
             The collection of examples bring together individual location-based studies and illustrate how a comparative approach can be applied to learn from the differences and similarities between catchments around the world along gradients of climate and landscape features.
